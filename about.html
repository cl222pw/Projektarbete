							<h1>About the creator</h1>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>My name is Carl-Emil Loob and I am the creator of this webpage. I am a 19 year old student at Linn√©universitet in Sweden. The program I'm attending is Interaction Design. <br><br>The idea for a webpage such as this one was one I originally had back in High School. I hated the fact that I had to use google and wikipedia to find what games were coming out in the following few months. It was a very inefficient method of finding such simple information. The reason why I'm doing this now is that I am creating a webpage for a university course.</p>
